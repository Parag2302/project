    <h1>What  is  PG  Vocab ?</h1>
     <p class="main">
        A wholistic approach towards vocabulary building.
        This web application is developed in order to put in sight the need for improvement in globally accepted language for communication.
        The need of this web application can be seen locally as we struggle for developing a better command over english language while specifically preparing for interviews.
        Not only this helps in finding meanings to words, it enables us to learn correct pronounciation as well as a better and entertaining medium towards learnig new words.
